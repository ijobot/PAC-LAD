# PAC-LAD

This was a fun tutorial with Anya Kubow on Scrimba's "Front End Developer Career Path".  Her version was a basic PAC-MAN clone, just to teach and ingrain some of the basic tenets of javascript.  I wanted to personalize my version, so I changed it to PAC-LAD.  It's a game where an Irish lad has to drunkenly navigate a dive bar eating while eating chips and drinking pints.  Meanwhile, he must avoid the dodgy langers in tracksuits asking to bum cigarettes.  Enjoy!
